Introduction
============

ownCloud utilizes WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) to access documents on the ownCloud server.

WebDAV, an extension of HTTP, allows users to edit and manage documents and files stored on Web servers. It makes the Web readable and writable and provides the ability to create, edit or move documents on a server. Some network infrastructure can be configured to block WebDAV by default, so be sure that load balancers, firewalls, and routers are configured to allow WebDAV.
